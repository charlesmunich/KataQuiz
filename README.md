# KataQuiz
My submission for Direct Supply's Kata technical project.

# Notes
Can expand quiz size by adding pagination to API requests.
Currently only supports multiple choice questions.
Selecting an answer and pressing back before next does not save the answer, can be fixed with an onaction when radio button is pressed
